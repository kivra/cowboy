== Changes since Cowboy 2.14

The following patch versions were released since Cowboy 2.14:

=== Cowboy 2.14.2

Cowboy compiled without `COWBOY_QUICER` set would
have a number of Dialyzer errors. Now in that
scenario the HTTP/3 code is fully behind ifdefs
and Dialyzer no longer complains.

Now when `COWBOY_QUICER` isn't set:

 * `cowboy:start_quic/3` is no longer defined.
 * `cowboy_http3` compiles to an empty module.
 * `cowboy_quicer` compiles to an empty module.

=== Cowboy 2.14.1

HTTP/2 Websocket did not call `terminate/3` on abrupt
socket close (without a close frame being sent first).
This is now fixed. Do note however that the Websocket
session process must trap exits to call `terminate/3`.
